# Nigh Sky
## What is it 

Night Sky is a little animation project, I wanted to test my skills with GIMP and get back on my feet with Vanilla JS.

## How does it work ?

Simple : \
I use a discord art from the ShadowPC server and separated the scene in 4 different scenes : \

- The Sky
- The Mountain
- The first part of the land
- The second part of the land

## How to use it ?

You can see the website in the githug page right [here](https://devinou971.github.io/night-sky/src) 
You can simply clone the repo and open the index.html in your browser.\
The images do take a while to load, it's because they are pretty high quality.\
